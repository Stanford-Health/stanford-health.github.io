	  Your goal is to test new wearable devices, document their use, build data extraction tools and iPython notebooks analyzing their data.
	  <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qfvfxlfDxhugso7cibP5gn6c4Q7Zbox'>See an example here</a>.
	  We have many devices in our lab, and are continuously purchasing more.
	  Currently we are interested in documenting the new Apple Watch and iPhone.
          This is a fun way to get a detailed look into your personal health and apply your data science knowledge.
	  We do not expect you to have any advanced background in data science other than knowing basic statistics and probability. 
	  If you have a course with final data science projects, you're welcome to use the notebooks you develop.<br>

	  Your goal is to define on what parameters and how to evaluate wearable devices.
	  Our PI Michael P Snyder often gets asked the question: "What is the best smart watch?".
	  To answer that, you need to formalize what metrics are important to evaluate wearable biomedical sensors on, and then perform the evaluation.
	  Currently, we are looking to expand our evaluation to sleep, mental health, and continous glucose monitoring (CGM).
	  You do not need to know anything about wearables before starting this project, but we do require that you have some background similar to a rising pre-med junior.<br>

          <b>Who's responsible for the Wearipedia project?</b> This is conducted at Stanford University, led by CS PhD student <a href='https://alrojo.github.io/'>Alexander Johansen</a> and chair of genetics <a href='https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab.html'>Michael P Snyder</a>. The project has several post doc and undergraduate collaborators.

      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>What is a wearable?</b> A wearable biomedical sensor devices, often referred to as wearables, are an electronic accessibles that can be worn either as a watch, in clothes, or in some cases embedded partially or fully withing the body.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>What are examples of wearable devices?</b> Smart watches, fitness trackers, EEG headbands, chest straps, smart sleeves, and patches with needles partially inserted into the skin to measure blood sugar.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>What's the Wearipedia project?</b> An analysis of what the best wearables are, a tool set to extract data from wearables, example code to visualize and analyze wearable data, and a website to conveniently showcase these findings to clinical researchers and data scientists.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>Will i get a publication?</b> Everything we work on, we publish. If you make a significant contribution, then yes. A significant contribution could be setting up testing infrastructure (Wearables infrastructure engineer), testing five devices (Wearables data scientist), or writing a section on what devices are optimal for testing sleep disorders (Wearables biomedical scientist).

      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>Who's the Wearipedia project targeted?</b> Clinical researchers who wants to conduct decentralized clinical trials.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>What is a decentralized clinical trial?</b> In conventional clinical studies participants had to go into a clinic or hospital to get monitored. In decentralized clinical trails participants can be recruited virtually and have devices (e.g. wearables) shipped to their home for monitoring and documentation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>Why do we care about decentralized clinical trials?</b> Cost can be significantly reduced (for sleep analysis, an Oura ring gen 3 is $299 versus a $3000 per night polysomnography), many more participants can be recruited; including areas that are not in close proximity to clinics and hospitals, and the tools are much easier to access and use; which allows adoption outside of highly specialized clinical settings.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="FAQelem">
        <p>
          <b>How do we help decentralized clinical trials?</b> By better understanding the quality of devices, what we can expect from them, developing tools for easier access, and making the tools available with example scripts we empower adoption.
          In particularly, we empower smaller research groups, and a broader community, that does not have the personel to have dedicated professionals handling wearable access and development.
          Our goal is to have accessing health information, and running clinical experiments, accessible to basic python users.
